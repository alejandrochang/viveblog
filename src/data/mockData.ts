  seriesScripture: ['Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?" '],

        'Self help is a myth that is pushed in the world. Were weak and we need help. Luckily we have the greatest Advocate of all the Holy Spirit',
        'We must focus on things above, focus on satisfying the Spirit, spending time with the Lord and denying our flesh (to strengthen our Spirit).',

        'The cost of marriage is chosing to die to yourself for the life of your partner. The benefits of marriage come at the COST of EVERYTHING. Youre no longer living for yourself. Youre living for the other person. The cost of discipleship is similar where everything is given up in exchange for Jesus.',
        'Just as the disciples when they walked with Jesus and ate with Jesus, they left their former lives for a new life. Following the Rabbi was a testament that they would take new instruction, and their old way of living was over.',
        'Theres a lot of believers in todays day in age who want all the benefits of being a disciple with none of the cost. However, the true benefits of Christ come when we reflect the life he lived. When we do the will of the Father. The cost of that discipleship is everything.',
        'Even during the times of Paul with the epistle letters the gospel was being dilluted. There was an idea of justification by the law. The idea that you could be justified by your historical culture. However, this is no excuse to dilute the grace of God.',
        'Cheap grace looks like grace without the cross. "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." James 1:22. The cost of discipleship is everything. The cost of discipleship is the cross. The cost of discipleship is the death of yourself. The cost of discipleship is the life of Jesus.',
        'It cost the Father and the Son everything to provide us salvation. Lets pursue the Lord for he is worthy. Surrender is hard today as the first time, because it cost us something. But the cost of discipleship is worth it! Jesus is more than worthy.'

We are called to be the light of the world. We are called to be the salt of the earth. We are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus. We are called to be the body of Christ.',

We are called to be the servants of Jesus. We are called to be the worshippers of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.',
        'Kingdom service is not an invitation, but an expectation. By Grace we are saved, but once were saved there is this expectation of works. We are called to put that freedom we have in Christ to work. Those who acknowledge Jesus in front of others will be acknowledged by Jesus in front of the Father. To acknowledge Jesus is to carry him wherever you go. His presence through you should be transformative.',
        'People make the excuse of burnout as the reason they dont serve. But if you are serving out of the love for the Lord, you will never burnout. The Lord provides the oil that allows you to keep going. You will be filled with the Holy Spirit. You will be filled with the love of God. You will be filled with the love of Jesus.',
