      "The crowds gathered to see Jesus and witness the 'new' Kingdom that he professed. Everyone had pre-conceived notion of what this Kingdom would look like, but it was very different from what they expected. They wanted a King to come and overthrow the Romans, but Jesus came to overthrow the sin of the world.",
      "Jesus through his entrancne demonstrated he was a finisher. His eyes and gaze were set on the prize and the flory before him. He was focused on the cross and the resurrection. He was focused on the freedom of the people and the salvation of the world.",
      "Now in days people want praise for the half-commitment, but reward and honor only comes from reaching the finish line, from the fulfillment of the calling. Jesus was focused on the fulfillment of the calling, not the praise of the people.",
      "There was a huge distinction beteween the commencement and the completion of the calling. The commencement was supported with chear, love and people. The completion was longely, painful and full of suffering. The completion was the cross.",
      "Fullfillment is about FOCUS. Theres nothign fun about sacrifice and pain, but thats why we set our eyes on Jesus, on things above and not on things below. We set our eyes on the prize, on the finish line, on the freedom that has already been paid for."
