    notes: [
      "In this series Pastor Adam goes deep into the book of Acts. In Acts 12 we see the story of Herod who was struck down by the Lord by accepting the peoples worship instead of directing it to the Lord.",
      "The Word says he was instantly struck down by angel of the Lord! His death began as soon as he decided to hoard onto the glory. It is clear as day that we were made to worship the King, and not hoard onto the glory.",
      "This happened during the time that the church was being strengthened, where people were being put into spiritual training, the church was growing, the church was being strengthened. Momentum was happening!",
      "King Herod knew of what was happening in the church, he knew of the miracles and the wonders that were happening. He knew of the power of the Lord, but he chose to take the glory for himself. King Herod Agripa was the King of the Jews, who had relationship with Rome. This is why he was placed as King of Judea. His primary function and job was to keep peace between both the Jewish people and the Romans",
      "A lack of reverence for God was why King Agripa was persecuting the church. We can see the beginning of Acts 12 where Herod put James to the sword and arrested Peter which is mentioned that it `pleased the Jews`. He was more in fear of pleasing men than pleasing God.",
      "The inhabitants of Sidon and Tyre came to offer King Agripa praise (which was a common practice of the time for Kings and leaders). They were trying to make peace with the King, but the King did not give the glory to the Lord. He accepted the praise and the glory for himself.",
      "From the information Luke gives, one might expect that Agrippa was suddenly overpowered by worms that consumed him in a matter of seconds, and one can envision his death. But Luke does not say that Herod died immediately, only that he was “struck down” immediately. According to Josephus (one of the best historians for the Jewish people during this time), Herod Agrippa I was immediately incapacitated by a severe pain his stomach; the pain lingered for five days before he died. The book of Acts tells us that the cause of death was worms (parasites, probably) directly from the hand of God.",
      "This gives us such a clear illustration how the glory of God cannot be contained by humans. How when we don't give the glory to God, it is the beginning of our demise. Humans were not meant to hold on to glory but to direct it towards the Lord, for it is he who allows us to receive honor. We were made to worship, made to give the Lord honor and that is what we must do to live a life of fullfillment.",
      "To summarize, are you building the Lords Kingdom? or yours? I challenge you to reflect on this notion, reflect on the glory you have been given and where you are directing it. Are you directing it to the Lord or are you holding on to it for yourself? One leads to everlasting life, while the other begins the path to decay.",

    notes: [
      "In this impactful series Pastor Keira talks about the importance of revering Jesus through understanding that Jesus is much more than just a friend. In Matthew 13 we see that Jesus was not able to do many miracles in his hometown because of their lack of faith. The people of his hometown were familiar with Jesus, they knew him as the son of Joseph the carpenter, they knew his siblings and their preconceived thoughts of who he was. They were familiar with his family and his background negating the power Chrit had.",
      "This same concept happens to a lot of us who continue the wlak of faith. Questions we should ask ourselves are: Have I drifted? Is there too much familiarity in my relationship with Jesus? Do I treat Jesus as my homie? Do I treat Jesus as my friend, but not revere him? Do I treat Jesus as my buddy, but yet forget to give him my heart? Do I treat Jesus as my mate? Do I treat Jesus as my bro, but do I not love Jesus as my Lord?",
      "Have I drifted to continue doing the work the Lord has called me to do, but without any heart? Without any correct heart posture. Have my acts become religious over relationship. Is my relationship out of pure benefit or out of true heart posture towards my King?",
      "Familiarity breeds contempt. We are exposed to certain people, certain opportunnities and blessings. We become familiar with them and we begin to take them for granted. We begin to lose the reverence for them, which in turn leads to a lack of honor, reverence and awe of the Lord.",
      "This happens due to this warning, that if you just have Jesus as your friend, you're going to nullify Jesus in your life. You will make him invalid, ineffective. Because Jesus is more than just your friend, he is Holy, he is the Lord.",
      "Some of us are struggling to see the power and the miracles of God, because the Lord will guide us to the place where we will see the power of God through the reverence, through making him Lords of our lives. We cannot take the benefits of the sanctification without honoring the one who we are sanctified through.",
      "Coming back to the Fear of the Lord can be done by these 3 actionable tips:",
      "1. Go to God first: Who you love and what you love will show you where you are going to first. The Lord wants you to spend time with him, to seek him first. Seek the Lord first and he will guide you to the right path.",
      "2. Get from God first: What you love first has the power to define you. If we want our identity in Christ, we need to receive from God first. To receive our love, validation and identity from the Lord.",
      "3. Give to God first: You give your first to what you love. The Lord is telling us to 'place him first' again!",
      "This is the way to make Jesus the Lord of your life, to bring back the reverence to the Lord in your life. The King loves to be first. By placing our values in the truth and the one who is the truth, we will be able to see the power of God in our lives.",

      "The Church began with a bang, with a shaking. We can see this in the beginning of Acts as the Church begins to grow, 3000 people are saved. Miracles begin to happen with the Church. The Holy Spirit comes in full power as a bang that shakes the room (Acts 4:30) as they prayed and were filled with the Holy Spirit.",
      "God is into the shaking, last week we saw in Hebrews how everything will be shaken and everything not on foundation will not remainn. God likes to shake things up, from our surroundings to the individual, the Lord will shake us out of complaceny.",
      "As the church began to grow we saw radical generosity where most people were responding right, however there was a few inauthentic actors as well. Annanias and Sapphira did not respond correctly to the Lord. They liked the benfits of the church, but they were not authentic in their giving.",
      "Through this scripture we see that there was a lack of reverence for the Lord from them. They were not reverent to the Holy Spirit which led to death. There was no requirement for them to give, it was from a place of inauthenticity that they pursued to 'give' to the church. Based on the scripture theres an implication that they as a couple came into agreement to not give all the money in the sale of the land. However, they chose to lie instead of give what they wanted to give. They wanted the praise of giving all they have, when they hadn't.",
      "We see this issue still happens today where people like to trust God in part (holding onto him with one hand, while holding on to our own desires with the other). We need to be able to trust God with both hands, to be able to give all we have to the Lord.",
      "When Annanias and Sapphira saw how much they were going to give, they chose to keep back what they already planned on giving. The oppositie of fear is familiarity, which shows they had the wrong fear. This is what creates the difference between devotion to the Lord vs. religion.",
      "Something we can see is that a lack of fear of God will lead to fear of man. The wrong fear/reverence will result in death. The right fear/reverence will result in life. The only way to get rid of the fear is with fear of the Lord!",
      "When thinking about discipline and disciple we begin that both interesect so closely. If I am to become a disciple I have to be formed in discipline, for the Lord loves to discipline his children! God is not nice, but he is kind, he is the embodimient of the fruit of the Spirit. The Lord disciplines the ones he loves.",
      "By the Glory of God grace allows us to get a grip!!! Grace is our gateway to see and understand the reverence of the Lord. Grace liviing is a reminder of the grip that we want to hold onto. Holding on to Jesus with all we have in full reverence to him."

      "In this new series 'The Life I Now Live' Pastor Adam dives into the book of Hebrews.

The author is encouraging them to keep the faith and to keep their eyes on Jesus.",
      "In the Old Testament we see the Israelites were terrified of the presence of God. They were so terrified that they asked Moses to speak to God on their behalf. They were so terrified that they asked Moses to be the mediator between them and God. They were so terrified that they asked Moses to be the one who would hear from God and then tell them what God said.",

The presence of God is not something to be terrified of, but something to be honored. The presence of God is not something to be scared of, but something to be respected.",
      "The scripture alludes to us returning to reverence and awe of the Lord. When we think of our new life in christ do we think of a big moment and little change or a little moment and a big change?",
      "The writer of Hebrew compares 2 mountains: Mt. Zion and Mt. Sinai. Mt. Sinai was a place of fear and trembling, a place of darkness and gloom. Mt. Zion is a place of joy and celebration, a place of light and life. The writer of Hebrews is saying that we have come to Mt. Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.",
      "Mt. Sinai the ancient mountain where the Law was created. The reverence came out of fear of breaking the covenant. For we know that breaking the law resulted in death. The reverence was out of fear of the consequences of breaking the law.",
      "Mt. Zion is the mountain represented based on the new covenant formed by the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord. The reverence comes out of love for the one who saved us. Mt. Zion is about convictions not by fear.",
      "You can love God and not fear him. Loving God is what he does for us. Fearing is what you do for him. I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless is a true reverence for the Lord.",
      "Reverence is knowing that the grace of God is to be honored to the point of my action to be driven by convictions. This means a genuine gratefulness from our heart! Not to nullify this grace with casual convictions, but with boldened convictions.",
      "How strong our your convictions? Do they withstand the shaking that is upon us? The Word says how things will be removed, unshakable things will be the only that remain, our foundation should be on the solid rock, on the Mt. of Zion.

He was blameless in the eyes of the law, but he realized that the New Covenant had come and that it was not only better but the only way.",
      "The Lord uses the most unlikely people to do the most unlikely things. He used Paul who was a persecutor of the church to be the greatest missionary of the church. Even with the persecution of the church, the Lord used it for the good of the church.",
      "Salvation is intricate yet such a simple concept. Its the free gift of God that is received through faith and belief. Sometimes we have difficulty of accepting salvation, asking whether we are worth it from our POV.",
      "Looking at the disciples as an example we see that they were not worth the trade for Jesus' life. They were not worth the trade for Jesus' life, but Jesus thought they were. Jesus thought they were worth the trade for his life. Our Lord Christ Jesus is the one who made the final declaration that we being sinners and ones who betrayed him are worth it in His eyes.",

He gave his life for us so that we could be with him.",
